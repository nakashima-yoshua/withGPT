# Simple Tetris PWA

This is a very small Progressive Web App that runs a basic Tetris game in your browser.

## Running locally

Serve the files using any static file server, for example with Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. You can install the PWA for offline play.
